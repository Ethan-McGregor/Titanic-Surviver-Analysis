# Titanic-Surviver-Analysis
###################
This analysis is for the Titanic Kaggle competition both training and testing sets were obtained from Kaggle.

 This script is an ensemble of many different machine learning algorithms. I fit each one to the training data then run it on the test data to see how accurately the model can predict whether a given person would survive the titanic or not. It uses age, class, gender, ticket price and more.
